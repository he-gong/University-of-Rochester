- 给学生的注意事项
  be sure to initial next to the paragraphs that have lines(这是啥意思?)
    - 每个房间最多两人，不得留宿他人

        - 内容
          We allow only 2 students to occupy any size apartment. This is the most frequent violation that
results in lease cancellation. Occupancy by more than the 2 students will result in a 50% rent increase and legal action (see lease agreement for details). In the past, we have found that students who chose to add additional, unauthorized occupants did so because they could not afford the apartment. Before signing the lease, be sure that your portion of the rent can be paid in full, without the need to add additional, unauthorized occupants. Also, student residents living at Rustic Village during the summer term are prohibited from storing other individual’s personal belongings due to housing complications.
    - 邮件包裹的收件人必须是住户，不得代收他人邮件
        - 内容
          Mail and packages may only be sent to the apartment for those residents that are registered at the
address. Do not allow anyone to use your address for any purpose. When mail is received for a person not listed as an occupant, it legally implies that this is the address for this person. This will serve as proof of the unauthorized occupancy.
    - 为了避免打扰到别人，请注意以下几点：
        - 晚上交友时减少噪音
          Minimize noise disturbances when having friends over during the evening hours. 
        - 晚上在公寓里走路要小声
          Avoid heavy walking and running in the apartment, especially in the evening.
        - 注意电视音量
          Be mindful of the volume level when watching TV, listening to music, playing video games, or talking on the phone, especially late at night.

        - 户外吸烟时与公寓建筑物保持距离
          When smoking outside your apartment, you must be 20 feet from the building, unless it is a non-smoking building, in which case you must be 50 feet away from the building. We have these rules in place to ensure that smoke does not drift into the open windows of the apartments.
    - 为了保持干净的公寓环境，请注意以下几点：
        - Grease:每天清洁厨具烤箱灶具，减少油脂残渣，从而避免火灾和虫害
          Clean the kitchen floor, oven, stove/range, stove wall and all appliances on a daily basis to cut down on grease and cooking residue buildup. Never put foil on the burner rings or stove wall. Buildup of grease on the stovetop creates a fire hazard and can cause insect infestations.

        - Fire Safety:
          for your safety and the safety of your neighbors:
x	Rustic Village will charge each resident on the lease $100, if in the event evidence is found that
any building system (including smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors, locks, etc) were tampered with, disabled, or removed from its original location. Residents will also be reported to the Fire Marshall and face serious fines from them as well.
-Never leave food cooking unattended.
-Never leave candles burning while not at home.
-When smoke from cooking sets off the alarm, there is a “hush” button that can be pressed to silence the alarm temporarily.
Helpful Hint: Cooking food on a lower temperature will produce less smoke.
        - Bathroom:
          To keep the bathroom clean and free from mold, which is caused by excessive moisture, there are simple steps to follow. Be sure to keep the bathroom door open when not in use and run the fan while showering to prevent the formation of mold because of the moisture. Use shower curtains at all times. Keep the bathroom dry—never leave standing water on the bathroom floor, as it will cause damage to the floor, vanity, and could leak into the apartment below.
        - Toilet:
          Only toilet paper should be flushed down the toilet. If the toilet does not flush after the 1st time, it is clogged and it should not be flushed again. If your toilet overflows and causes damage, you will be held financially liable. Be sure that you purchase a plunger and know how to use it.

        - 保险:
          Renter’s insurance is required for all residents. Our insurance does not cover the personal property of the tenant nor does it cover damage done in the event that a fire originates from your apartment. For your protection, we require purchasing a renter’s insurance policy. See the attached document for more information.
    - 不要买用过的家具，特别是床，容易有虫
        - 内容
          Do NOT purchase or accept used furniture, as it may be infested with insects, especially bed bugs. You will be held financially responsible for any insect issues that are created due to your own neglect or wrongdoing.
    - 若发现有虫，请立刻联系管理员，永远不要自行解决
        - 内容
          Any insect problems MUST never be treated by the tenant. It is crucial that if you believe you have bed bugs, that you contact our maintenance staff immediately. We know how to quickly and safely treat the problem. DO NOT SELF-TREAT FOR BED BUGS. The products that are available for purchase do not actually kill bed bugs, but only forces them to move to a new location. In the case of apartments, that means your neighbor. This only makes the treatment to eradicate bed bugs more difficult and more costly for the person responsible.
    - 租金是月初第一天到期，请设置为自动缴费，若不会设，请联系管理员
        - 内容
          Rent is due on the first day of the month. We suggest setting up an auto payment for the rent on
the 1st of every month to avoid late fees. Be accurate when entering your information into the online RentPayment system. Input errors on your part will result in your payment being returned by the bank. This will result in bank charges and late fees being added to your account that will not be reversed for any reason. You must plan payments accordingly when you are on vacation/out of town to avoid late fees. If you are unsure of how to set up your account, our Resident Relations Office would be happy to help you.

        - 内容

Relations Office. Any roommate changes must be processed and approved by Management and each co-signer. Fees and restrictions apply.
    - 重复违反上述规定将取消租赁，并支付法律手续费
        - 内容
          Repeat lease violations for any of the above rules will result in lease cancellation proceedings
and/or legal action. You will be held liable for payment of the remainder of the lease agreement as well as the associated legal costs.
